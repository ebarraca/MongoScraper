# MongoScraper


Mongo News Scaper is web application that scrapes news from the Onion's website.

Whenever a user runs the app on the local server or on the heroku app link, article headlines, the article link, and the article snippet are scraped from petapixel.com's website.
Mongoose was used to save the scraped data to the database (mongodb.)
